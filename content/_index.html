          <strong>HELLO! It's nice to meet you!</strong> These four categories describe just some of the many fields 
          I've been involved in over 10+ years of professional experience in the open source space. I approach each 
          creative project with self-motivated energy and enthusiasm, while delivering results within reasonable 
          timeframes. All work is well researched for best practices to ensure that the code being committed is minimal, 
          well documented, well tested,  and the most effective solution for the problem at hand. The goals of the 
          company are taken into account, whether that's scalability for future growth of the company or codebase, 
          adaptability, accessibility, intuitive user design, or mobile and responsive web design.

                  I've worked extensively (for 10+ years) in a position of <strong>lead website manager</strong> 
                  and <strong>senior frontend developer</strong> on a variety of frontend projects and applications 
                  both as a freelancer and in a fast paced environment at a technology company startup. My 
                  development work has included direct collaboration with marketing, design, sales, and product 
                  teams as well as managing projects both independently as a technical lead and with groups of 
                  engineers in Agile, Scrum, and other collaborative environments. Every project presents a 
                  challenge and a new technology to learn; I'm prepared and flexible enough to develop all layers 
                  of the stack from backend to frontend (including work outside of the stack) regardless of prior 
                  experience.

                  during the process. Technical support was required for PostgreSQL database environments, HA 
                  PostgreSQL environments, and PostgreSQL for Kubernetes environments, which included installation, 
                  configuration, upgrades, query optimization, and actively troubleshooting bugs and breaks in
